                     <p>In this 4-day workshop, students will learn from the ground up how to sketch letters, make refinements, and produce a finished analog or digital piece. Standard drawing tools will be used to test ideas and push various parameters, though no art or design background is required. This course covers the fundamentals for whichever styles students care to pursue, as well as techniques for harmonious compositions, and eye-catching effects.</p>

                     <p>Have you ever designed a headline that needed an image, or worked on an illustration that needed a headline—but thought creating and putting the two together could be problematic? It can be pretty disappointing when letter and image come from two different sources—and are just slapped one over the other! This workshop will help you uncover ways that your work can actually be stronger when you discover how to successfully integrate these forms with each other—as they are two sides of the same coin. The purpose of this four-day workshop is to demonstrate how the rules governing letter and image can be bent and how the two can be fused to create new hybrid forms.</p>
                     <p>Participants will select and work on at least two of several assignment options and receive constructive feedback at various stages during the workshop. These stages can include research, rough pencil thumbnails, development sketches, and refinement and execution of final artwork. This work may take the form of finished drawings, be brought into the digital realm, or completed using traditional media. By the end of the class students should have a better understanding of—and the ability to take advantage of—the complex relationship between letterforms and imagery.</p>

While Python programming knowledge is helpful for the workshop, it isn’t required of the participants. But abstract thinking is a must. Wondering how to make variable fonts? Problems with getting started with a project? Workflow feels like it needs optimizing? Wonder what you could really be doing with Python? Bring a problem!</p>

In this one-day workshop we’ll look at different outline constructions, extrapolation and designspace planning. We’ll use Superpolator and RoboFont, and maybe also a bit of python.

Its lively forms, embellished strokes and distinctive styling make Spencerian Lettering especially well-suited for posters, labels, book jackets, editorial work and advertisements. In this workshop students will learn how to create and implement Spencerian Lettering for various design applications.</p>

                     <p>In this 3-day workshop, students approach the practice of typeface design by looking at type and the shapes within. Through research and analysis of shapes you will learn the language of letter forms both on a visual and on a narrative level. By sketching and drawing digitally an alphabet will be completed. At the end participants will have an ‘unfinished’ typeface with lowercase or uppercase letters. But each one will be forced to draw something different than they are used to.</p>

                     <p>Did you ever wonder why existing design tools make you do so much repetitive work? Why is it difficult to get back to sketching once your design tools take over? This workshop is intended for designers who want to code and for developers who want to design. Even if you decide that coding your designs isn’t what you want to do yourself, you will learn how to talk to developers.</p>

                     <p>This two-day workshop will provide a basic overview of freehand brush lettering. Referencing various tools, techniques and models, participants will hone their drawing skills as they take a wordmark from concept to completion. Comprehensive slide presentations, demonstrations, skill-building exercises and personal critiques will provide further guidance as students acquire a practical foundation for drawing and implementing brush lettering in various design contexts.</p>

                     <p>Learn to program generative animations with Python in DrawBot in this two-day workshop. We will dive into programming time-based behavior and motion, creating perfect loops. Abstract patterns, letters, geometric shapes, icons: you name it and we will make it move. The results will be short animated loops in the form of animated gifs ready for the web, or video output suitable for post-production.</p>
