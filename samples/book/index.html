North, where the Gobblers take the children they steal--including her friend Roger. North, where her fearsome uncle Lord Asriel is trying to build a bridge to a parallel world.</p>
                     <p>Can one small girl make a difference in such great and terrible endeavors? This is Lyra: a savage, a schemer, a liar, and as fierce and true a champion as Roger or Lord Asriel could want.</p>
                     <p>But what Lyra doesn't know is that to help one of them will be to betray the other. And that she alone is destined to win, or to lose, this more-than-mortal battle.</p>

								<p class="first-p">Sir Philip Pullman is an English novelist. He is the author of several best-selling books, including the <span class="title">His Dark Materials</span> trilogy.</p>
								<p>Born in Norwich, England, he grew up in Llanbedr in Ardudwy, North Wales. He graduated from Exeter College in Oxford with a degree in English. He married Judith Speller in 1970 and briefly taught children aged 9 to 13 at Bishop Kirk Middle School in Summertown, North Oxford.</p>
								<p>Publication of his second children's book, <span class="title">The Ruby in the Smoke</span> in 1986 prompted him to stop teaching, to which he later returned as a part-time professor at Westminster College in Oxford.</p>
								<p>He began writing <span class="title">His Dark Materials</span> in 1993, with the first installment being published in 1995 as <span class="title">Northern Lights</span> in the UK. Pullman won both the Annual Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize for the first installment, with high critical praise following for the later two books. In the US, <span class="title">The Golden Compass</span> won many more accolades, which quickly garnered him recognition as one of this generation's great children's literature authors.</p>
